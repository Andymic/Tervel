# Installing Tervel #
#####################

If you simly wish to run a few quick tests to see how Tervel works and performs, a working runtime environment has already been set up on IEEE Xplore. Check it out: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7515610/

System Requirements
===================
Supported Platorms:
	- Ubuntu 16.04

Downloading Tervel
==================
Clone Tervel from the git repository:

	$ git clone https://github.com/ucf-cs/tervel

Building Tervel
===============
Dependencies
	- g++4.8.0 or greater
	- gflags

	$ sudo apt-get install libgflags-dev

Building

	$ cd tervel/tests
	$ make all

Running Tervel Tests
====================
You may run the binaries located in tests/Executables under a subdirectory with a syntax similar to version_NA_10000_10000. Inside, you may run one of the binaries with a command such as

	$ ./BIN.x

Where BIN is the name of the executable you wish to run. The test will execute with default parameters, which includes 0 threads. Therefore, it is normal to see output results containing little to no information. For an explanation on how to change these parameters, see the User Manual.

Next Steps
==========
See the User Manual for a more in-depth overview on how to perform Tervel tests.
See the Tutorial for a quick walk-through on how to use Tervel to create a wait free and lock free stack.
